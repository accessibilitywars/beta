They are also designed to be playable in actual play, when one has to react to mechanics.\nExperienced players should be able to beat the DPS benchmark without changes.\nOur builds are organized with a tag system. You can filter by expansion, profession, power/condi as well as accommodation needs, as listed below:\nLOWCOG\nLow Cog Builds have low cognitive complexity. These builds have less decisions, lower memorization/knowledge\nrequirements, and definitely no long rotations. We aim to keep to amaximum of 3 actions in a combo when possible.\nLOWPHYS\nLow Phys Builds have low physical complexity. These builds don't use too many different buttons. The goal\nis to minimize lateral finger movement on the keyboard/mouse/controller.\nLOWREP\nLow Rep Builds have low physical repetition. These builds have a reduced need to press the same button rapidly.\nWe lean on autos, and the ability to hold the weapon key down in many cases here.

I'll briefly mention something down below but I mainly just want to cover the basics.\nLike the regular heal Firebrand build you maintain quickness through your elite ''Feel my Wrath!'', Mantra of Solace and Mantra of Potence. However what is different from my build is that you maintain a huge amount of constant passive healing while also outputting permanent protection for very high durations. This build specifically has as much passive, or mostly passive healing as possible which you mostly do by just auto-attacking on hammer. This way you are free to just focus on using your elite and mantras to keeo quickness rolling on your group. As long as you always have a mantra charge on cooldown and you use your elite as quick as possible when it's off cooldown your squad is going to be very happy.\nSome of the standout traits are Absolute Resolve and Battle Presence, which gives 5 allies around you a ticking unique heal over time, all the time. Pure of Heart which makes blocks from your Aegis tick a big heal on everyone you effect, and Selfless Daring which pulses a big AoE heal around you every time you dodge. You also passively buff the endurance regeneration of your group through Purity of Body\nAs with any Firebrand build you have a lot of free slots for any utility you'd like to bring and you still have your tomes which are filled to the brim with all kinds of goodies from reflects to stability, to increased healing and AoE pulls. I don't want to touch on all the tomes because there is just too much to go over. But I went with the two utilities ''Advance!'' and Bow of Truth. Both can be swapped out for anything you'd like, but ''Advance!'' is both an AoE heal due to the block as well as entirely negating one possible large hit. Bow of Truth does ludicrous healing in a wide area on a low-ish cooldown, and it has 2 charges. But in all honesty, auto-attacking is all you need to do.\nWhat makes this build work is Writ of Persistence. Your symbols stay for 2 more seconds and symbol ticks pulse healing on anyone they effect. Your 3rd auto-attack on hammer drops a symbol that pulses protection so you are entirely passively healing by auto-attacking. You have a mace and shield as well which can be used as a knockback, heal, and multiple blocks, but even auto-attacking on mace and using mace 2 does a huge amount of healing. You can even combine the two for moments of really high pressure.\nThere is just so much more you can do, but this has dragged on for way too long already. Keep auto-attacking on hammer and keep using your mantras and elite skill, and you'll maintain quickness and keep your squad healthy.

The main goal was to make a build that doesn't require that many button presses while still maintaining alacrity without any issues, and passively sustain the squad through several traits that interact with eachother. It ended up being so useful that we did our first Mai Trin CM kill with it right after the patch hit.\nThe build overstacks so much alacrity that you can just use one of your wells every couple seconds and shortly after that you will have hit the 30 second cap on alacrity. Every shadowstep you do also does several other things. To begin with, every well is also a shadowstep so the following effects trigger with every well you press\n-Shadow Saviour in Shadow Arts pulses a heal for you and allies.\n-Traversing Dusk heals and revives around you.\n-Any barrier on you breaks, and is distributed to allies.\n-Monk Runes trigger increasing your healing output.\nYou have many ways to gain barrier as well which as I mentioned before will shatter after a shadowstep and is granted to allies. You have so much base health, and so much extra health in shroud, that this barrier is totally not needed for you. However your squishier allies surely will benefit from the protection it grants.\nOutside of the alacrity and wells, you can also use sword 2 over and over to spam shadowsteps making your traits trigger and pulse more healing. Shadow Shroud also needs to be mentioned since it is basically always full, and it gives you a huge amount of health. Even better attacking in shroud gives one of your allies healing, and leaving shroud gives allies around you a massive heal. Any overhealing is even turned into barrier.\nUsing Siphon on enemies or allies gives you barrier as well which you can share around, and it also gives allies might, fury, swiftness and vigor. Well of Bounty also pulses boons and this one uniquely pulses boons which are currently not present on people inside it. It can apply very unique and hard to get boons like resistance, aegis or stability.\nThe build is very forgiving. You can freely take any elite you'd like, and swap out one of your wells for any utility of your choice. You already have a lot of breakbar damage from offhand pistol but you can without any issues even slot in Well of Silence for another huge 500 breakbar damage on a relatively low cooldown.\nHonestly there is just so much more you can do with very little work. But this has turned into a large essay already.\nI didn't get a proper video for this but if you want to try something fun, you can also run sanctuary runes if you are with another healer in a squad. Sanctuary runes give you barrier equal to 20% of all healing you get, and you can shatter that barrier and give it to allies with shadowsteps. \nGear\n\nWeapons:\n\nPlagueDoctor Scepter/Dagger with Concentration/Transference Sigils\nPlagueDoctor Sword/Pistol with Concentration/Water Sigils\n\n\nArmor: PlagueDoctor with Monk Runes\nTrinkets: PlagueDoctor\nFood &amp; Utility: Bowl of Fruit Salad with Mint Garnish, Bountiful Maintenance Oil\n\nTraits and Skills\nTemplate Code:\n[&amp;DQUUJywnRz8VGwAABRsAAAYbAAAIGwAAERsAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGw2Skills\n\n","description":"","id":"https://accessibilitywars.github.io/builds/retired/hsac-thief-most-creative/","title":"Thief - Creative"},"https://accessibilitywars.github.io/builds/retired/hsac-warrior-best-dps/":{"body":"Standard dps role as a Blade Sworn pulling 31k dps.
